# SWIPE PAST YOUR TETRIS

## INSPIRATION

Inspiration drawn from childhood game I played, that is Brick Breaker Game

## PROJECT

Indulge into this hack of tetris, the game which you would never get rid of. This project would make you sharper and active. Let's see how much score you could pull it off. One of the challenging game to play with. So here tetris blocks gets pushed into the counter and user needs to adjust the blocks falling down accordingly so that they could last as much as they could. Once the counter is filled up, game gets over. You can never get tired by playing this.

## HOW IT'S BUILT

This is built using python. Had worked on it from scratch  from adding functionalities, providing blocks, activating right and left arrow keys, taking input form mouse, pushing falling pieces, cramping rows and columns, flipping up the falling pieces and many more. 

## CHALLENGES FACED

The prominent challenge was bringing all these functions together to make game work practically. Had to nightout with lots of bugs involved. Also the inputs weren't recieving, due to which falling blocks gets stopped half the way. All weird things happened concerning the project execution. Struggled with flipping the blocks and bringing them in right frame for syntax to get initialized.

## ACCOMPLISHED

I'm happy with what I achieved and nailing the game isn't indeed a great achievement for me. As I never worked on games before. But thanks to this hacks, I now know how to work with games in python. This motivation would help me work on such games in future. I can't wait to recreate all the antique games which shooked the world once upon a time including mario, duck game and etc.

## WHAT I LEARNT

I learnt working with pygame library and also dealing with functions and providing user friendly interface, pushing right logic into right class and debugging with hell lot of errors.

## FUTURE OF SWIPE PAST YOUR TETRIS

The next version of it would be on counting up the scores and make the GUI more efficient along with exciitng buttons to add up more funcitonalities to it.
